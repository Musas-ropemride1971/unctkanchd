Just walked out of The Life List, and wow, my brain feels like a blender left on overnight. You know those  s that make you think you’ve just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 a two-hour therapy session? Yeah, this was it. I went in expecting a popcorn flick and came out feeling all sorts of philosophical… and maybe a little annoyed. Not sure if it was the late-night show or the taco bell I shoved down before it, but man, such a whirlwind of something.

First off, why do  s like this always have a lead character who’s like a living Pinterest board trying to find themselves? Seriously, what’s with the endless self-discovery arc? Sarah, the protagonist, she’s got this journal—basically the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s sacred scroll—and she scribbles down life wishes like a caffeinated squirrel. Sometimes ambitious, sometimes cringy.

The theater was too cold. Classic. Murphy’s law says the more I try to settle into existential cinema, the harder the universe drops the metaphorical ice cubes down my back. Sarah’s dealing with profound stuff, ticking life goals, and here I am…needling my frozen limbs to life, half expecting someone to roll a slushie cart down the aisle.

> And those musical montages? Here’s me, asking if there’s an unwritten rule that says emotional epiphanies must always be paired with Bon Iver-esque tracks. Like, oh no, it’s a slow guitar strum—something significant must be happening. Sarah decides to finally go skydiving! What a twist! Hold my popcorn.

At least the side characters weren’t wallpaper with woeful one-liners—or maybe they were, and I just didn’t notice over the sound of Sarah’s aspirational monologues. But there were laughs. Not all of them intentional, which is exactly what you want in a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 about life choices, right? Right?

Quick side note, my phone buzzed after the   because clearly, the universe needed to remind me that not one, but two of my own life list goals remain unchecked. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for a re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Maybe. 

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf(Live your best life!
);
    return 0;
}
```

Ultimately, will I recommend you rush to the theater or sit glued to the couch and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with a bowl of oreos? Maybe both, depending on how much you need a good cathartic sigh or just a reminder that your list isn’t scribbled affairs on a napkin. A part of me wants to mail my own life list to Sarah and say here, knock yourself out! But another part's just resigned to feel these feels—tired, slightly annoyed, but oh-so-curiously content.
